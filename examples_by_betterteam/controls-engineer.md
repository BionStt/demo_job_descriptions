# Controls Engineer

Controls Engineers are responsible for ensuring that plants create the best products possible in the most efficient manner. They are highly analytical and use these skills to examine and improve processes in order to increase productivity. At the same time, they are responsible for ensuring that all equipment is properly maintained. As they perform these functions, Controls Engineers must also be able to work with other departments and external parties to create and implement processes to increase the plant’s efficiency.

## What does a Controls Engineer do?

Controls Engineers must be master multitaskers. Their goal is to ensure that the plant is running smoothly and efficiently while also meeting quality and safety standards. Controls Engineers design, implement and maintain processes that help manufacturers increase productivity.

Control Engineers must be adaptable, striving to find creative solutions to problems as they arise and assist in the implementation of predictive maintenance plans. They must be able to analyze plant processes and help make improvements based on their extensive knowledge of electronics, engineering, and mechanics.
