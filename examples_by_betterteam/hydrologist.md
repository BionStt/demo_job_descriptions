# Hydrologist

We are looking for highly analytical researchers who are comfortable undertaking both office and field work. Hydrologists can expect to wade in waters to collect soil and water samples, analyze a variety of water-related data sources, create data models to make predictions about water scarcity and floods and produce highly detailed reports based on their findings.

Hydrologists combine quantitative rigor with environmental curiosity to become water scientists. They adopt a holistic approach to studying water by placing it at the intersection of water, society and government policy.

## Responsibilities

* Evaluating concerns around dam safety, local water projects and hydroelectric power plants.

* Determining water pollution levels.

* Doing field work to collect water and soil samples.

* Measuring water properties to determine pH levels, volume and flow.

* Modeling data to predict the occurrences of floods, pollution and water scarcity.

* Determining the best means of water maintenance, management and conservation.

* Making use of historical data on water usage.

* Producing written reports based on research findings.

## Requirements

* Bachelor's degree in Geosciences, Engineering or related field.

* Master's degree is preferable.

* Proficient in mathematics and statistics.

* Trained in data modeling and forecasting.

* Knowledge of environmental law and government policy.

* Experience with digital mapping software.

* Excellent written and verbal communication.

* Highly analytical mindset.

* Good interpersonal skills.
