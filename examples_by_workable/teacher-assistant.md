## What is a teacher assistant?
A teacher assistant supports the teacher in planning and presenting lessons, and helps students learn. Teacher assistants may work part-time or full-time. They’re usually required to pass assessments before they can work with students, although a formal university degree may not be always required.


## What does a teacher assistant do?
Teacher assistant duties often depend on their level. For example, a higher-level teacher assistant may be qualified to occasionally replace a teacher in their absence, apart from handling basic administrative tasks. The ages of students could affect the teacher assistant duties, too. For example, if a teacher assistant works at a preschool, they’ll supervise children during play or lunch. But, if they work at a high school, they’ll probably be more focused on creating lesson plans, preparing material for classrooms and assisting with remedial teaching.
Also, some teacher assistants work with students with disabilities, assisting <a href="https://resources.workable.com/special-education-teacher-job-description">special education teachers</a>.
