## What is a Quality Engineer?
Manufacturing Quality Engineers work in industries such as automobile, transportation, textile and industrial equipment, and their role is to monitor, test and report on the quality of products. Depending on the position, they might inspect raw materials, components, mechanical systems or final products.


## What does a Quality Engineer do?
Quality Engineer responsibilities vary across industries and companies, but the main tasks include testing systems and procedures to ensure they meet technical standards and creating quality and safety documentation. QA Engineers are responsible for identifying technical issues and getting to the root of the problem, too. They also proactively recommend solutions that’ll improve product durability and overall performance.


## Quality Engineer duties include:
* Auditing systems based on ISO 9001:2015 requirements

* Determining quality metrics for all manufacturing procedures

* Monitoring the entire production cycle and reporting on malfunctions

## What skills does a Quality Engineer need?
Quality Engineers usually hold a degree in mechanical or industrial engineering. Candidates for managerial roles might also hold a masters degree in quality assurance, but this is not a must-have, as the quality engineer role is often learned best on the job. No matter the seniority level, QA Engineers should be good team players because they have to collaborate with various departments (e.g. production, engineering and support). Other essential quality engineer skills include problem-solving abilities and attention to detail.
