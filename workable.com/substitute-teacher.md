Substitute Teachers replace regular teachers for a short period of time (e.g. a week or a month) or for the entire academic year. They make sure that the lesson plan is followed and the classroom is running smoothly in the absence of the regular teacher.


## What does a Substitute Teacher do?
This is usually a role for entry-level teachers who are currently taking their first steps in teaching before they become full-time educators. In some cases, Substitute Teachers work for a few hours per day or week and replace regular teachers on a day-to-day basis depending on short-term or even last-minute needs (e.g. when a teacher calls in sick).
Sometimes, they replace teachers for a longer period of time, for example, when the regular teacher is on parental leave or sabbatical. In this case, Substitute Teachers work full-time with a fixed employment contract.
