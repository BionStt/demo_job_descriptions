# How to Write a Recruiter Job Description

Since recruiters are intimately familiar with the job search process, it’s important to write a clear and relatable recruiter job description to find the best candidate. Above all, you’ll want to explain the job expectations as concisely and directly as possible. We suggest including information that will highlight your company’s core values and mission, as well as day-to-day job expectations. Use brief, bullet-pointed lists for qualifications and responsibilities, ensuring they align with your needs.

## What Does a Recruiter Do?

Every company relies on its people for success. Recruiters find those people. They play an integral role in an organization’s growth by understanding the needs of hiring managers and sourcing the best talent to fill open positions. Whether they work directly for the company hiring or as part of a third-party recruitment or staffing agency, recruiters spend much of their time finding and attracting qualified candidates, coordinating the interview process, and following up with candidates.
