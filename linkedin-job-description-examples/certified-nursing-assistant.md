## What Does a Certified Nursing Assistant Do?

When you’re seeking medical care, you expect to receive accurate, detailed, and attentive care–and certified nursing assistants, or CNAs, play a key role in ensuring that’s exactly what you get. A CNA helps patients or clients with healthcare needs under the supervision of a Registered Nurse (RN) or a Licensed Practical Nurse (LPN). These specially trained professionals work in physicians’ offices, hospitals, clinics, and other healthcare facilities in clinical roles. Doctors and RNs or LPNs count on CNAs for a variety of duties including assisting with examinations, administering injections or medications, drawing blood for testing, or conducting basic laboratory tests. Whichever role they play, CNAs are a vital part of every patient’s’ healthcare experience.   <em>   </em>
