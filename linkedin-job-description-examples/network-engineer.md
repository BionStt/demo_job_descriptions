## What Does a Network Engineer Do?

If a company computer is malfunctioning, it impacts one employee productivity. If the network goes down, the entire company is affected—and even stopped in its tracks. Network engineers play a critical role in the success communication and effective business operations. They monitor and alter computer network topology based on user issues, traffic congestion, preventative maintenance, necessary infrastructure upgrades, and new product offerings. These technical experts are concerned with uninterrupted “uptime,” knowing that one command can bring the entire network down and cost the company thousands or even millions of dollars in lost business. Thriving network engineers are natural collaborators and will often interact with management and staff to facilitate the achievement of a successful network system.
