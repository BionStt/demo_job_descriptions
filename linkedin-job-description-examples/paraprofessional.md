## What Does a Paraprofessional Do?

Paraprofessionals are an essential part of the education system, but they do not have a license to teach. Working in an elementary school, secondary school, or daycare facility, a paraprofessional is an educational worker who performs many duties both individually with students and organizationally in the classroom. They may work closely with teachers on general classroom lessons or activities, or one-on-one with students who have special needs or disabilities. While they may not hold an official teaching license, paraprofessionals are just as essential to the learning experience, often being called upon to assist with the teaching of new concepts or translate information to help students better understand.
