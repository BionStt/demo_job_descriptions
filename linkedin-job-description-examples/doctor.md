## What Does a Doctor Do?

A doctor, also commonly referred to as a physician or medical practitioner, is responsible for evaluating, diagnosing, advising, and treating patients who come in with specific medical issues, or for routine care, such as an annual exam. Some doctors choose to pursue a specialization during their schooling and residencies, while others become primary care doctors. All doctors collaborate with an integrated medical team that includes nurses, medical assistants, specialists, and other medical professionals. It takes years of education, training, and experience to become a doctor. Once licensed to practice, they typically work long hours and may cover on-call shifts as well. But the reward of helping people live healthy, happy lives goes a long way toward outweighing the challenging nature of being a doctor.
