## What Does an Engineer Do?

From software to bridges, engineers tend to be innovators and problem solvers. Working in electrical, mechanical, civil, chemical, geotechnical, or management disciplines, engineers apply the principles of mathematics, science, and technology to build things better and optimize the way they work. Their efforts often lead to commercial applications that meet consumer, societal, and business needs.

Engineers can work in a variety of industries, but they typically choose to focus in a single realm, from automotive and agriculture to telecommunications and energy. Many also have a range of technical skill, but choose to specialize on a specific function such as installation and maintenance, design, production, safety and quality assurance, an research and development.
