# How to Write a Data Analyst Job Description

Appealing to the ideal data analyst candidate starts with crafting the ideal job description. Be direct about your expectations and goals, telling candidates how their work will have an immediate and positive impact on your success. Don’t be shy about using language that communicates the culture and values of your organization.

Also, avoid including a laundry list of responsibilities and skills. A strong post should be concise and simple, so make sure that you take the time to differentiate between the nice-to-haves versus true requirements to be successful on the job.

LinkedIn data has shown that shorter job posts (between 1-300 words) have significantly higher apply rates relative to the average. More specifically, the <a href="/talent-solutions/blog/job-descriptions/2018/new-job-post-stats" target="_blank">short job posts got candidates to apply 8.4% more than average</a>, while medium length job descriptions (301-600 words) performed 3.4% below average and the long job posts (601+ words) did only 1% better than average. By keeping the information focused solely on what they need to apply to know, you’ll get more applicants.
