# How to Write a Secretary Job Description

To attract a pool of talented secretary candidates, you’ll need to keep your job posting brief and to the point. Be straightforward about your company’s mission, the specific duties involved, and even how the successful hire will contribute in the role.

Personalize the day-to-day details based on your job expectations, using bullet points for easy reading. Review your description carefully to ensure everything is accurate and nothing is missed.
## What Does a Secretary Do?

For many organizations, the secretary is the first line of contact in an office setting. For others, he/she has a direct report for whom they provide administrative support. In either capacity, secretaries keep business operations running smoothly and efficiently. On any given day, you can find a secretary greeting visitors, answering phones, handling emails, taking meeting minutes, coordinating schedules, making appointments, being resourceful, and even potentially solving logistical problems that arise.

Secretaries are needed in virtually every industry, relied on for their ability to ensure order, nurture performance, and find the answers. At all times, these multitaskers are counted on to help people and processes stay organized and truly thrive.
