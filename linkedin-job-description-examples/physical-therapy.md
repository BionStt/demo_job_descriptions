# How to Write a Physical Therapy Assistant Job Description

Finding the right Physical Therapy Assistant (PTA) for your practice is a matter of putting together a job posting that is professional and detailed—while also driving home your practice’s overarching mission.

If it’s appropriate, consider adding a unique voice to your post. PTAs do very important work, but that doesn’t mean the atmosphere always has to be formal and serious. Don’t be afraid to give candidates some insight into your practice’s particular tone and culture. Use your own judgment as to what feels right for your company.
## What Does a Physical Therapy Assistant Do?

A PTA works under the guidance of a physical therapist to implement rehabilitation plans for patients who are suffering from physical injury or disease. Unlike physical therapists, PTAs cannot diagnose patients and must work alongside physical therapists to deliver care plans. PTAs also gather data on a patient’s progress, input that data into online software systems, and modify treatment plans as directed by the managing physical therapist.
