## What Does a Sales Manager Do?

The lifeblood of any business or organization is the sales department. Leading the team of  salespeople is the sales manager, the person that conducts the company’s revenue engine. Sales managers hire and motivate high-performing sales teams, and lead them to generate leads, hit or exceed revenue forecasts, and ultimately meet customer needs. From pharmaceuticals to software to financial management, nearly every business sector has a sales manager building relationships and closing deals. The most successful sales managers develop a thorough understanding of the products and services they sell, find leads and close deals easily, and can coach and mentor a team of salespeople to do the same. The ultimate goal is to win clients, customers, and profits.
