## What Does a Radiologist Do?

A radiologist is a medical doctor trained to diagnose and treat illness or injury through the use of medical imaging techniques. These include x-ray, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A radiologist interprets the images created or gathered by these machines and then communicates their findings. Radiologists play a key role in diagnosing illness in patients. Thanks to them, other doctors are able to collaborate and determine the best course of treatment, without taking more invasive measures. To become a radiologist, one must earn a medical degree and spend time specializing in the field.
