## What Does a Marketing Professional Do?

When it’s time to raise awareness for a company, product, cause, or solution, it’s time for marketing. People who work in marketing are often creative professionals with an understanding of people’s tendencies, preferences, needs, and wants. They may create marketing strategies, may implement on these strategies, or both, with varying responsibilities based on company size, the size of their department, the ambition of their strategies, and their own skills.

Day-to-day, you can find these intrepid souls conducting market research, brainstorming and executing ideas, liaising with external clients for project execution (if the work is for an agency or consultant), and taking on individual tasks assigned to achieve business goals. A thriving marketing employee understands the basics of branding, marketing campaigns, and product promotion. They may work for a marketing or advertising agency, or as part of an organization’s internal marketing department.
