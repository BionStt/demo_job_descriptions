## What Does a Medical Assistant Do?

When you visit a doctor or physician, you anticipate accurate, detailed, and attentive care. Medical assistants play a large role in ensuring that’s exactly what you get. These specially trained professionals work in physicians’ offices, hospitals, clinics, and other healthcare facilities in both administrative and clinical roles. Administrative medical assistants help a facility run smoothly by scheduling appointments, welcoming patients, recording their histories and personal information, coding and maintaining medical records, and much more. In a clinical setting, medical assistants may assist physicians with examinations, administer injections or medications, draw blood for testing, or conduct basic laboratory tests. Whichever role they play, medical assistants are a vital part of every patients’ healthcare experience.
