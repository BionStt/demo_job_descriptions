## What Does a Personal Care Assistant Do?

Personal care assistants are indispensable caregivers that are trained to support people who are sick, injured, mentally or physically disabled, or elderly and fragile. Also known as home health aides or personal caregivers, they typically work in their clients’ homes, assisting them with daily activities such as bathing, feeding, grooming, taking medication, shopping, and performing housework. Personal care assistants also serve more active roles outside the home, helping their clients with transportation to appointments, running errands, and visiting family. Above all, they help the people in their care feel more dignified, and assist them in living a more active and fulfilling daily life.
