# How to Write a Paralegal Job Description

Finding the ideal paralegal starts with crafting the ideal job description. A strong posting introduces the values and culture of your organization. With simple, concise language, it tells candidates how their work will influence your organization’s success from the moment they begin and for years to come.

Carefully review your expectations to make sure they align with the paralegal position. Your lists of duties, responsibilities, and qualifications should be no more than six bullets each. Use direct language and avoid industry jargon.
## What Does a Paralegal Do?

Paralegals are indispensable components of legal teams in a vast array of organizations, including law firms, government agencies, corporations, and more. They conduct legal research, investigate facts about a case, and draft legal documents for which lawyers are ultimately responsible. Expert researchers and information managers, paralegals can specialize in litigation, corporate law, intellectual property, immigration, and more. These professionals are well-versed in the latest electronic discovery software and utilize a range of technologies to organize and present information — and accurately maintain legal databases.
