# How to Write a Construction Worker Job Description

The foundation of your search for a high-quality construction worker is the job description. What are the qualifications and skills this professional should bring to the table? Is there an opportunity for career growth? How will they contribute to company’s success? When crafting the job posting, include specific, measurable objectives that the new hire will be expected to achieve. This was identified as very helpful to the candidate in a recent LinkedIn study where people were asked to highlight the parts of job description that were most important. Including these goals is an easy way to significantly improve, differentiate your job descriptions, and even may contribute to a more diversified applicant pool.
## What Does a Construction Worker Do?

Construction workers use strategy, skill, and stamina to help with the building of residential, commercial, industrial, and civic structures—from roads to bridges, office buildings to factories. Depending on the size and scope of the project, a construction worker may work in conjunction with a team, focusing on a specific element of the project, or jump around from task to task as needed. Each job comes with unique working conditions, which may include simple loading and unloading, to scaling challenging heights or risking exposure to hazardous materials. At its core, construction is a physically demanding job that appeals to those who would rather do something hands-on than sit behind a desk.
