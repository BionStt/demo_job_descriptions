# How To Write a Oncologist Job Description

Attracting an ideal oncologist starts with writing a strong job description. Make certain that your oncologist job posting is clear, direct, and brief. Introduce your organization in a way that engages the job seeker by including some detail about your mission, values, and culture. Explain the contributions of this role—and tell candidates why they’ll be crucial to making a difference in people’s lives.

## What Does an Oncologist Do?

Oncologists are medical doctors who manage the diagnosis, care, and treatment of cancer patients. They may practice as general medical oncologists, or a focus on a more specialized area such as gynecological oncology, surgical oncology, or radiation oncology. Typically, patients are referred to an oncologist when their primary physician requires a more expert opinion or diagnosis based on any number of symptoms. Upon diagnosis, the oncologist becomes the patient’s main healthcare provider, often directing a multidisciplinary team involved in their course of treatment. Depending on the type of cancer, this may involve chemotherapy, radiation, immunotherapy, surgery, or any combination of these. Oncologists continue to monitor the patient throughout their treatment and into post-treatment and recovery.
