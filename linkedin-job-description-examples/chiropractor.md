## What Does a Chiropractor Do?

Chiropractors are healthcare professionals who believe that any structural or biomechanical issue affecting your spine will also have an impact on the function of your nervous system. To rebalance this delicate relationship, they use a variety of methods including spinal manipulation, stretching, and cold and hot therapy to help restore function and improve overall health. When you have regained normal mobility in your spine, the hope is that it will eliminate or reduce nerve irritation and restore normal function.
