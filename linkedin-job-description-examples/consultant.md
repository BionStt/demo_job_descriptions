# How to Write a Consultant Job Description

Finding a qualified consultant starts with a solid job description. If your posting is straightforward and simple, you’ll attract plenty of quality consultant candidates. It’s important to give job seekers a peek into your company culture so they can both get excited for the role—and determine if they’re the right fit for you. The most compelling job descriptions are realistic, detailed, and brief. This keeps candidates engaged and able to envision themselves in the position.

## What Does a Consultant Do?

Consulting covers an incredibly broad range of topics, organizations, clients, and industries. A consultant can work independently or as part of a consulting firm, specializing in any given field of expertise. Essentially, consultants are hired to share their expertise and knowledge to help businesses attain goals and solve problems. Sometimes, companies bring on consultants to perform day-to-day work and augment or supplement staff—and save the fixed overhead costs associated with a full-time employee. Other times, they’re brought on board for a specialized purpose: to troubleshoot, tackle a specific challenge, optimize something specific, spin off a successful business unit, revive a failing business, etc.
