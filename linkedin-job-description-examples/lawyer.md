# How to Write a Lawyer Job Description

To find an exceptional lawyer, start by creating an irresistible job posting. The best job descriptions include some background information on the company culture and insight into the impact the individual will have in the short- and long-term.

When listing out the qualifications, responsibilities, and objectives you expect from a lawyer, be brief and direct. Review every word before you post it to make sure your list accurately aligns with job expectations.

## What Does a Lawyer Do?

The legal system impacts nearly every aspect of our society, from driving a car to buying a house. Lawyers or attorneys (or counselors at law) are the backbone of that system, serving as guides to contract terms, laws, regulations, policies, and judicial decisions at all levels (federal, state, and local)—as well as advocates for specific, client-friendly drafting and interpretation.

As advisors, lawyers counsel clients about their rights, obligations, and risks in a variety of business and personal matters—and make recommendations accordingly. As negotiators, they represent the interests of their clients to skillfully gain a satisfactory result. As advocates, they step in for an adversary in a criminal or civil case, writing complaints and motions, gathering and presenting evidence, and applying it to support their arguments. In all circumstances, lawyers must understand the law—and apply it persuasively.
