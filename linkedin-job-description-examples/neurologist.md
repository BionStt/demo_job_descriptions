# How to Write a Neurologist Job Description

You’ll attract the neurologist candidates you’re looking for if the job description you present is realistic, simple, and straightforward. Let candidates know how important they will be to your organization’s success, and what they can expect of the work environment. Include details on the qualifications you require and the day-to-day responsibilities, but avoid a long list or an abundance of jargon. Keep your neurologist job posting brief and engaging, and the right candidates will apply.

## What Does a Neurologist Do?

A neurologist never has a quiet day. This medical specialist treats diseases of the central nervous system, brain and spinal cord, peripheral nerves, and muscles. Most of the time, a primary care doctor refers patients to a neurologist if they have symptoms that indicate a neurological condition, such as stroke, headaches, numbness or tingling, weakness, or memory loss. Other times, emergency medical episodes require immediate neurologic care. The field of neurology offers these medical experts many different career paths, depending on their preference. Some choose to be general neurologists, while others practice specialities. For example, an epileptologist works exclusively with people prone to seizures, a veterinary neurologist works with animals, and a neurosurgeon performs operations.
