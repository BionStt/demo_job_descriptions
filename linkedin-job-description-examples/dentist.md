# How to Write a Dentist Job Description

The most effective job descriptions are engaging, easy to read, and detailed. Begin by envisioning a highly effective dentist and listing the qualifications they possess. What is their educational background? What professional assets do they have? How will they impact the day-to-day and ongoing success of the dental practice? Once you’ve specified these expectations, summarize some details about the office culture and values. You want job seekers to consider whether their values align with yours before they apply.
## What Does a Dentist Do?

A dentist is a licensed medical professional who cares for patients’ teeth, gums, and oral health. Daily responsibilities can vary widely, depending on exactly what kind of dentistry they practice, and in what environment. Some dentists own their own practices and work independently, or with a small staff. Other dentists have partners in their practice, and some work for more established dentists as associate dentists. Overall, a dentist’s goal is to deliver preventive oral health services, and diagnose and treat dental disease in its earliest stages. This ongoing dental care will help their patients maintain optimal oral health throughout their lifetimes.
