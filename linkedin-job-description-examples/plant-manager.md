## What Does a Plant Manager Do?

Plant managers are at the helm of a manufacturing or production facility, and are actively involved in daily operations as well as the company’s long-range plans. At some larger plants, they may be assigned to manage one area, but typically, they are responsible for the entire plant’s operations. The plant manager supervises all activities of that facility, which often involves overseeing team performance, expediting the receiving and shipping of goods, and ensuring efficient, organized storage. By streamlining all plant activities, this detail-oriented leader can help drive overall profitability and customer satisfaction—two of the main goals of any consumer-facing organization.
