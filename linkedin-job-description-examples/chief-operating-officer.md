# How to Write a Chief Operating Officer Job Description

Think about your typical chief operating officer (COO): busy, driven to meet objectives, and practical to a tee. As such, your chief operating officer job description should be brief, high-level, specific, and realistic. Start by introducing your company. Then, outline your expectations. Once you’ve painted a picture of the work environment, clearly spell out the qualifications, duties, and objectives. Go ahead and set the bar high, because you’re more likely to get high-quality candidates that way. A strong COO job description conveys the day-to-day and long-term impact of the position, and avoids long-winded detail or empty jargon.

## What Does a Chief Operating Officer Do?

The chief operating officer of a company is second in command. This professional reports to the chief executive officer (CEO) with a focus on operationalizing strategy. While a CEO is concerned with long-term business goals, the COO is tasked with implementing daily operations, aligned with that goal and the company’s strategies. His or her individual role depends largely on the company itself and the CEO’s personal style. In many cases, the COO is chosen specifically to complement the strengths and weaknesses of the CEO, or to work in tandem to bring the best leadership to the forefront.
