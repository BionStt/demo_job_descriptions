# How to Write a Sales Job Description

It’s important for your organization to attract and hire the right sales specialists with a great job description. An effective posting gets to the point quickly. It makes a great first impression by revealing information about the company as well as details about the requirements and responsibilities. Sales candidates should understand exactly what they can expect from their first day on the job, and how their efforts will impact the business.

Carefully create your list of qualifications and duties using brief bullet-pointed descriptions. Be sure the end result aligns with your expectations and is clear of any/all typos or other issues.
## What Does Sales Do?

While marketers focus on generating interest, the act of buying is motivated by sales. Virtually any business that has a product or service to offer relies on sales professionals to generate leads, meet with potential buyers, close deals, upsell more business, and build relationships.

In a retail or food service business, the sales reps are the friendly, helpful floor staff and servers. In the case of big ticket items, it often comes down to the abilities of a company's sales rep to persist, understand shifting needs, and perform skilled negotiations. The most successful salespeople can connect with others easily, learn quickly, and stay committed to the sale. Their efforts empower a thriving, profitable company.
