## What Does a Call Center Do?

Many large corporations require a call center to manage the large volume of calls they receive from customers, potential customers, suppliers, vendors, and other valuable contacts. Call center representatives act on behalf of the organization, providing information about products and services, taking orders, responding to customer complaints, processing returns, and performing countless other activities, depending on the company.

These professionals often have access to templated responses (or scripts) for the most commonly asked questions — and specific guidelines for dealing with requests or complaints. You might interact with call center reps in industries as varied as insurance agencies, banks, retail stores, government agencies, and more. The representative’s mission is to learn the ins and outs of a company’s offerings and provide the highest-quality support.
