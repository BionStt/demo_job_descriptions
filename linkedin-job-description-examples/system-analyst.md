# How to Write a System Analyst Job Description

Finding the right Systems Analyst for your open req starts with crafting a job description that is descriptive, enticing, and reflective of your company culture.  For example, if your company tends to be a more traditional and formal business setting, try adjusting the tone of your job post to match. This will boost your chances of getting applicants that are looking for a more professional environment.

On the flip side, be careful of getting too casual in the job description. According to a study conducted by LinkedIn, the candidates shown a very conversational job description – which included terms like “kickass corporate manager” and silly hashtags like “#spreadsheets4life” – was worse at attracting people. Candidates were 4x more likely to dislike the employer and 2x-4x less likely to apply. It’s good to be human and reflect your company culture. Just don’t go overboard to avoid discouraging applicants.
## What Does a System Analyst Do?

If you want your company’s business model and Information Technology (IT) systems to work together cohesively, you need a systems analyst. These professionals evaluate a company’s computer systems and processes, then help employees operate the systems effectively. Systems analysts must have a good understanding of both business and technology—plus be capable of explaining these systems in a non-technical way.

These professionals work in a variety of fields, ranging from finance and insurance to healthcare and government. Regardless of the specifics, all systems analysts are experts at working within a team to solve complex business problems.
