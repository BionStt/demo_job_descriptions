# How to Write a Substitute Teacher Job Description

Your job description is essentially your first impression for job candidates. It’s your chance to share some information about your school, the position, and the ways in which substitute teachers have made an impact. Avoid making laundry lists of qualifications and responsibilities, focusing instead on keeping things brief and to the point. If you give job seekers a clear understanding of what you expect from them, and what they can expect from the job, you’re likely to attract the best of the best.

## What Does a Substitute Teacher Do?

Even the most dedicated teachers need a sick day. When a planned or unplanned absence keeps them away from the classroom, a substitute teacher is there to fill in. Substitutes have fulfilled state requirements and registered with the local department of education before applying for the job. For many, substituting provides the teaching experience needed as they pursue their master’s degree in education. Others simply enjoy being in the educational field without being tied down full time. Most public school districts require a bachelor’s degree, while others accept a high school diploma. If the applicant is accepted, he or she will be placed on a list and receive a phone call or text message either the night before or the morning there is a need. From there, the substitute goes to the required class and follows the lesson plans left by the teacher.
