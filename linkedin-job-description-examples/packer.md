## What Does a Packer Do?

Much of the goods and products we rely on go through a meticulous packaging process before they get to us. This requires the skills of a capable, detail-oriented packer. Most packers work in a warehouse environment, preparing finished products for packaging and shipment. Typically, a packer will be assigned to a specific area, retrieve the items needed from the inventory, check that they are in good condition, wrap them securely, and pack them for shipping. Warehouse packing often requires physical strength and stamina to lift and pack heavy boxes and products.
