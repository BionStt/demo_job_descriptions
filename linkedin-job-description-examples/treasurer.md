# How to Write a Treasurer Job Description

To write an alluring treasurer job description, be specific—but don’t forget the big picture. Treasurer positions involve a lot of hard skills: analytics, finance, economic systems, banking, etc. But a successful treasurer isn’t just experienced—they’re also charismatic leaders, organizational whizzes, and expert managers.

Include the nitty-gritty details to attract qualified candidates, but delve into your company’s mission and values if you want to draw in candidates who are passionate about your company.
## What Does a Treasurer Do?

If you want to run a profitable company, one of your top priorities should be hiring an effective treasurer. A treasurer oversees every aspect of a company’s financial management—from fundraising and funding to banking and bookkeeping. To manage the various financial responsibilities, a treasurer will likely delegate work to finance sub-committees or other staff members. Oversight of financial systems and compliance with regulations, however, remain the responsibility of the treasurer. Finding a good treasurer can be difficult; the job requires advanced knowledge of financial systems, excellent organizational skills, and the ability to delegate effectively. But with the right candidate, your business will be more financially secure in the long-run.
