# Insurance Agent Job Description

To get stellar candidates through the door, we encourage you to craft an engaging job description that outlines the opportunity, stands out from the competition, and motivates the right people to apply. Your post is a chance to explain why the role is important to the company and the community. Excite candidates with specific tasks they will be charged with. Describe what success looks like in the role and how their efforts will make an impact.

Education, skills, and experience are optional inclusions for a job posting, but essential to attracting and identifying qualified applicants. Avoid a laundry list of qualifications; 6 and less works best. Finally, grab the reader’s attention by infusing your company personality into the description.
## What Does an Insurance Agent Do?

When you’re shopping for any kind of insurance, you typically interact with an insurance agent. In the realm of automobiles, healthcare, business liability, property protection, or something else, these professionals enable their clients to manage potential risk and loss by purchasing policies (or coverage) that will reimburse them if certain events occur. Working one on one with clients to determine their needs, insurance agents provide information about various insurance programs and policies, making suitable recommendations and providing overall guidance.

Organization and communication skills are essential to this role, as agents must often deal with multiple client needs—including advising on plans, understanding changes, and assisting with claims—at the same time. The most successful insurance agents are able to meet sales quotas by effectively delivering the best coverage at the best rates—and giving clients the assurance that they’ll be cared for, especially in the event of an incident or loss.
