# How To Write an Occupational Therapist Job Description

Finding a well-qualified occupational therapist to join your practice begins with crafting a comprehensive, appealing job posting. Your posting should inform candidates of the specific experience you’re seeking in a future employee, and give candidates an idea of how their work will positively impact their patients and coworkers.

While it’s important that you relate the importance of the work, it also may work in your benefit to touch on some of the benefits and perks you practice has to offer. Occupational therapists perform difficult, often demanding work, and candidates will be more compelled to apply if they know your practice offers support in return.
## What Does an Occupational Therapist Do?

An occupational therapist helps clients learn and perform the everyday activities they need or want to do. Occupational therapists may work with autistic children to participate in academic or social settings, elderly people who are experiencing physical or cognitive changes, or people of all ages who live with mental health problems or chronic pain. An occupational therapist may work with a client to improve their basic functions, but they can also help them learn to compensate for a permanent loss or damage. To improve a client’s health, an occupational therapist may assess their needs and come up with a plan to help make their lives easier. This plan may include a variety of cognitive or physical therapies.
