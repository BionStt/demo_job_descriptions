## What Does an Accountant Do?

For any organization, accountants are part of a financial backbone, enabling operations, furnishing strategies, ensuring compliance, empowering leaders, and more. Accountants fall into a number of categories, including Certified Public Accountants (CPAs), auditors, tax accountants, and investment accountants. In a CPA or other accounting firm, these skilled professionals form part of the firm’s revenue center. In other organizations, accountants provide the skills needed for business leaders to understand their financial resources—and preserve, allocate, and grow them accordingly.
