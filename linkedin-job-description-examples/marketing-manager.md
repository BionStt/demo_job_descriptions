# How to Write a Marketing Manager Job Description

With the current talent shortage making it increasingly challenging to find skilled workers in certain industries and roles, it’s more important than ever to write a job description that stands out from the rest.  That’s why you need to create a marketing manager posting that is concise, goal-oriented and also inspirational. Help people understand the expectations of this role - and reveal how the candidates will have an impact.  

If you really want to get a competitive edge, be sure to highlight what makes your company unique, including the perks. According to a survey by ManpowerGroup, almost a third (32%) of organizations are offering more perks to overcome shortages in “talent,” including things like tuition reimbursements, egg-freezing assistance programs, and even pet insurance. 
## What Does a Marketing Manager Do?

The only way people become aware of a product, service, or idea is if it’s marketed well. A marketing manager builds that awareness by developing and executing on marketing strategies to meet consumer need — and maximize profits. Working in industries as varied as advertising, hospitality, healthcare, finance, technology, retail, and education, marketing managers are integral to a company’s success. They manage internal teams, craft (or oversee) promotional messaging and products, and work to publish or distribute them to the public via media, advertising, and social media. Depending on the size of the company, they may be one of many marketing managers, specializing in a group of products or services, or a specific area of execution.
