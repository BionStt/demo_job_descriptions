# How to Write a Physician Job Description

If you’re looking to add a general physician to your hospital or medical practice’s team, start by writing a job post that is clear and direct, yet includes enough detail to convey the caliber of your facility to prospective candidates. Physicians are, by definition, highly educated, but you still need to clearly specify what you want in an ideal candidate. After all, you’re not just looking for a doctor—you’re looking for a doctor who will help make your practice a safe, comfortable place where patients receive superior care.
## What Does a Physician Do?

A physician (commonly known as a doctor), is responsible for assessing, diagnosing, advising, and treating patients. Some physicians choose to pursue a specialization at the end of their regular training, while others become primary care physicians. All physicians work within an integrated medical team of nurses, physician assistants, and other medical care providers. Becoming a doctor takes many years of school, internship, and residency, and once they’re licensed to practice, physicians often work long, difficult hours. The upside? Physicians get to do very rewarding work, dedicating their careers to helping people lead happy, healthy lives.
