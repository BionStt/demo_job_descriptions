# How to Write a Personal Banker Job Description

The best job postings are thorough and succinct. Your personal banker job description should clearly convey the job expectations, while including relevant information about your company and the qualifications expected from the candidates who apply. Be sure to give job seekers a realistic idea of what they can expect from their first day on the job, and how their work will contribute to the company’s long-term success.
## What Does a Personal Banker Do?

Personal bankers handle one of the most important assets in people’s lives—money. Banks rely on these individuals to deliver exceptional service, as they help customers achieve their personal financial goals. Day-to-day, these financial experts provide advice on a range of products—including trusts, bonds, equities, structured products, currencies, insurance-linked products, deposits, and loans. For example, a customer may visit the bank with a sum of $50,000, hoping to earn interest on their deposit. The personal banker will be expected to provide a range of financial products that are suitable, based on the customer’s unique needs.
