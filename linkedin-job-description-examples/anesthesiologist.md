## What Does An Anesthesiologist Do?

An anesthesiologist is a highly skilled medical doctor who specializes in pain relief and cares for patients before, during, and after surgery. During operations, anesthesiologists serve a central role in delivering anesthesia to a patient and regulating their critical life functions. Anesthesiologists are trained to understand how different medications will interact with a patient’s unique physiology and are responsible for diagnosing and treating any issues that may arise during surgery. Outside of the operating room, anesthesiologists help treat patients who suffer from pain due to chronic illness or injury.
