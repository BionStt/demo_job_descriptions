# How to Write a Chief of Staff Job Description

To attract the ideal chief of staff, your job posting should be concise and simple. It tells candidates how they’ll contribute to your organization from the moment they start, and how those contributions will impact your success. Additionally, it should introduce your organization in a way that communicates your conventions and values.  

Review your lists of duties, responsibilities, and qualifications carefully. Ensure every point accurately reflects the expectations for your chief of staff. Use direct language, avoiding jargon and slang. Keep your lists to no more than six bullets each.
