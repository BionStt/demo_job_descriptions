## What Does a Portfolio Manager Do?

A portfolio manager is a financial expert who oversees a large investment portfolio of securities with assets including equities, fixed income, commodities, real estate, and private capital investments. Whether working for a money management company, financial corporation, or for individuals, portfolio managers work to generate a return on assets, commensurate with the income and liquidity needs of an institution’s beneficiaries, clients, or stakeholders. Most portfolio managers start their careers as financial advisors or research analysts, using superior analytical skills and initiative to rise to the level of portfolio manager. The best and the brightest are meticulously detail-oriented, organized, and comfortable making serious decisions for others.
