## What Does a Forensic Psychologist Do?

What makes some people deviate from societal norms to the point of committing crimes or creating familial havoc? Forensic psychologists ponder and investigate this question, along with many others. They use the basic principles of psychology to get to the root of criminal and family behavior in specific cases, often working alongside the legal and criminal justice systems when called upon. Forensic psychologists do not deal solely with criminology. Much of their work involves clinical psychology, research, and application of these disciplines to a variety of issues, from victims’ rights to issues that impact families.
