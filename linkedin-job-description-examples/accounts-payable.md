# Accounts Payable Job Description

The most effective accounts payable job postings share the expectations and qualifications for the position in a concise yet thorough way. You’ll want to provide some insight into your company culture and how the potential hire will contribute on a day-to-day basis. But don’t spend too much time talking up your company and culture.

In a study by LinkedIn, candidates were shown job descriptions and asked to highlight the parts that were most helpful to them. The findings were that they do care about your company and culture - it’s just not as important to always include in the text of your job description. Many people in the study mentioned that they often look to get info on a company through its website, LinkedIn Company Page, or in interviews.

Rather, your time will be better spent visualizing your ideal employee and using that as a guide in crafting the job description. The better you describe the responsibilities, the more likely you are to find a good fit for the role.
## What Does Accounts Payable Do?

It’s been said that you have to spend money to make money, and this is especially true in the business world. As the costs and expenses of doing business add up, the accounts payable department is there to make sure all bills are paid in an efficient and timely manner. These financial specialists provide administrative and clerical support by processing, verifying, and reconciling invoices, monitoring expenses, and keeping a record of it all for tax purposes. With their precision and proactivity, the company is more likely to meet profitability goals, or to break even, in the case of a nonprofit organization.

To attract and retain the best professionals for your accounts payable department, you must create a solid job description. We recommend using the template below, adapted with your specific details.
