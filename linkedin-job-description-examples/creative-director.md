# How to Write a Creative Director Job Description

Finding a great creative director starts with an excellent job description. To attract the best creative directors, be sure share how their talent will impact the company and the team they will lead. Be clear and brief when listing the expectations, and let your company values shine through.

Once you have a solid first draft, verify that you’ve included all the important details and kept it as straightforward as possible. Providing too much information or peppering it with industry lingo may turn away quality candidates.
## What Does a Creative Director Do?

Within marketing and advertising agencies, at the helm of each creative department, sits a person with a unique blend of creative vision and business sense. That’s the creative director. This person leads his or her team of designers, copywriters, account managers, and sales representatives, guiding the marketing and promotional efforts that bring client products and services to market. Challenged to both inspire and brainstorm fresh ideas, manage deliverables, and captivate the target market, a successful creative director understands what people want and knows how to provoke action.
