# Assistant Manager Job Description

Your job description is the first line of contact with a potential assistant manager. To engage and entice candidates to apply, you must capture their attention—and truly stand out. Give job seekers an idea of what working for your company will be like. What will their main responsibilities be? How will they impact overall success? What qualifications should they bring to the table? If you include plenty of detail and present it in a concise, straightforward way, you’re sure to attract the best and brightest candidates.

## What Does an Assistant Manager Do?

Business always runs smoother when a manager has an assistant to rely on. The assistant manager ensures operational excellence by performing managerial tasks, such as scheduling, maintaining inventory, and/or evaluating employee performance. Regardless of the industry they work in, which can vary greatly, he or she bridges the gap between upper management and staff. These managers handle many operational tasks, often running a specific department or business sector. Assistant managers often engage in many of the same activities as their direct reports, leading by example, while providing support and training. Because they’re responsible for stepping into the manager’s shoes in his or her absence, this position is often a stepping stone on the way to a managerial role.
