## What Does a Copywriter Do?

An ad that’s as memorable as it is funny. An easy-to-read website that also informs. A brochure you want to keep and frame, rather than toss away. With these tools, a copywriter can make you laugh, cry, change your mind, and inspire action—all in 10 or fewer words. The best copywriters take readers on a journey that educates while it persuades.

Copywriters work for agencies (e.g., marketing or advertising agencies) or directly for organizations, including private companies, nonprofits, and even the government. Day-to-day, copywriters are tasked with writing clear and concise copy for ads, marketing materials, and websites, for virtually any audience and any industry.
