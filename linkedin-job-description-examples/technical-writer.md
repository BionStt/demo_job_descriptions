# How to Write a Technical Writer Job Description

To make sure your most complex information is easily and clearly understood, you need to hire a strong technical writer. That means crafting a strong technical writer job description. Your posting should introduce the culture and values of your organization with clear, direct language. Additionally, it should let candidates know what’s expected of them from the moment they’re hired, and how their work will have a positive impact on your organization.  

Your lists of duties, responsibilities, and qualifications should be no more than four to six bullet-points each. Review your lists carefully, removing those points that don’t accurately reflect the requirements and expectations of the position.  
## What Does a Technical Writer Do?

Clear instruction is vital, especially when it comes to complex and confusing subject matter. Technical writers are skilled wordsmiths that typically develop product manuals, how-to guides, website help sections, journal articles, and other content that distills technical information with ease and clarity. Whether gained academically or on the job, these writers often have a foundation in their subject matter, be it in science, medicine, engineering, software, manufacturing, or some other technical area. They build upon this foundation to break down complexities and get their readers—developers, project workgroups, engineers, consumers—on the same page. Their mission? To make processes easy to understand and products a breeze to use.
