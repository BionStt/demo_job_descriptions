# How to Write a Controller Job Description

Hiring the right controller is crucial for you company’s financial health. It all starts with the right controller job description.

## What Does a Controller Do?

As the leader of the accounting team, controllers are in charge of closely monitoring a company’s financial health. They typically maintain, manage, and analyze financial statements, payroll, budgets, tax compliance issues, and more. These financial experts work across a broad spectrum of industries, for companies both large and small. In a larger corporate setting, controllers often supervise a team of accountants and report directly to the chief financial officer (CFO). In smaller companies, the controller may be the only accountant, working with a team of clerks and reporting directly to the owner or CEO.
