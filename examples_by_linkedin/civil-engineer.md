## What Does a Civil Engineer Do?

Civil engineers work in both the public and private sectors to design the public infrastructure that enables us to live, work, and travel. With an eye on design and scalability, they develop and oversee projects that build the things we use every day—like roads, bridges, airports, water treatment facilities, and more.

Civil engineers are highly trained professionals; many specialize in areas like transportation, structural, or geotechnical engineering. They’re typically responsible for managing the projects that improve the way people and goods move from place to place.
