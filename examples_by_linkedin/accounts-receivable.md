## What Does Accounts Receivable Do?

Most companies operate by allowing a portion of sales to be on credit. In some cases, businesses offer this type of credit to frequent or special customers who are invoiced periodically. In other cases, businesses routinely offer all clients the opportunity to pay after receiving the service. Others pay immediately upon receipt of service. In all cases, the accounts receivable department is there to monitor and manage accounts and immediately follow up with any customer who has not paid as agreed. These financial specialists provide administrative and clerical support to ensure that books are always current and accurate so that management can make effective business decisions.
