## What Does a Construction Manager Do?

Construction managers coordinate and supervise the building of residential, commercial, industrial, and civic structures—from roads to bridges, and office buildings to factories. Depending on the size and scope of the project, a construction manager may work in conjunction with other managers, focusing on a specific element of the project. In all cases, they are a part of the construction process, from the initial planning and foundational work through to project completion, managing timetables and costs along the way.

Being a construction manager demands organization, attention to detail, and the ability to stay connected to the big picture. They should also have a deep understanding of all facets of the building process, which can only be gained through experience. As the intermediary between clients, architects, engineers, subcontractors, and regulatory personnel, this position also requires superb communication and leadership skills.
