## What Does a Security Officer Do?

Sometimes a lock, alarm, or gate aren’t enough to protect people and property. This is when a security officer (literally) steps in. Security officers are a living, breathing line of defense for businesses and its surroundings against external threats, intrusion, and circumstantial vulnerabilities. While specific responsibilities vary depending on the employer, there are some common duties that help to define the role. Overall, security officers are tasked with securing the premises and personnel by staying on patrol, monitoring surveillance equipment, performing building inspections, guarding entry points, and verifying visitors.
