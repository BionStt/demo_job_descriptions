# How to Write a Graphic Designer Job Description

Strong graphic designers are out there, and having a top-notch job posting is key to engaging them. The job description is your organization’s first impression, illustrating your mission, values, and expectations. As millions of job searchers look for the right fit, your goal should be to make it compelling, concise, and direct. A good rule of thumb is to include four to six bullet-points of information under each section. Once you have a first draft, read it over carefully to be sure it aligns with the job expectations and verify that all details are accurate.

## What Does a Graphic Designer Do?

Graphic designers develop visual concepts by hand or with computer software. Intended to captivate, inform, inspire, and/or persuade, a designer’s end product is often used in a marketing or promotional campaign, or a public announcement. Graphic designers work creatively, both in print and electronically. Above all, they are visual storytellers with the goal of engagement at a glance.
