If your company wants to find and hire an exceptional welder, you need an excellent job description. Start by envisioning the ideal person for the role. What qualifications and skills do they have? Next, think about your company and describe what sets you apart. What tasks can a potential hire expect to perform on a day-to-day basis? What’s your company culture like? Those in search of a welding job will want to align their values with yours, so it’s important to bring them to life in a brief, succinct, and engaging way. If you keep your welder job description detailed and realistic, you should have no problem finding your next team player.
## What Does a Welder Do?

Very few of the products we use and the structures we live and work in can be made from one piece of material. Because of this, welders are needed to fuse materials together. These technical experts help build and repair many of life’s essentials, from tools and medical devices to spacecrafts. In order to weld, cut, shape, braze, solder, or manipulate a workpiece, welders are trained to use an assortment of tools and equipment, including torches, gases, electrodes, hand tools, and industrial chemicals. However, many of these experts choose a more specialized route like ironwork or pipeline welding.
