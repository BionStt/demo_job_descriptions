## What Does a Web Developer Do?

In our heavily digital world, nearly every company has a website. The web developer, also called a web designer or webmaster, is the person who builds, adjusts, and/or maintains it. Web developers may work for small companies, large corporations, or as freelancers, using technical and creative skills to create functional websites. But there’s much more involved. A highly skilled web developer knows how to analyze user needs to ensure the content, graphics, and navigation provide a positive user experience. Depending on the level of skill demanded by the job position, s/he may be tasked with designing simple website layouts or more complex interactive website features. In all cases, a web developer uses knowledge of computer software, HTML coding, and graphic design to create a website that tells a story and achieves business goals.
