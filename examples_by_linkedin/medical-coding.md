# How to Write a Medical Coding Job Description

Finding the best medical coder for your company depends on a well-written job description, and it all starts with a powerful summary of the position and its role within your organization. While much of this will be a bulleted outline of duties, qualifications, and expectations, a large portion should convey what it’s like to work for your organization and how your candidate will make an impact on a day-to-day basis. Keep it short, sweet, and jargon-free whenever possible, and you’ll ensure that quality candidates will click, read, and apply.
## What Does a Medical Coding Specialist Do?

Medical codes tell the complete story of a patient's encounter with a physician and must be as specific as possible for reimbursement toward rendered services. A medical coding specialist, also known as a medical coder, knows how to create that story. This data management professional transforms healthcare diagnoses, procedures, medical services, and equipment into universal medical alphanumeric codes, which are applied during the medical billing process. They are skilled at extracting precise information from documentation, test results, and reports, and assigning the appropriate codes to create a claim that will be paid by insurance carriers.
