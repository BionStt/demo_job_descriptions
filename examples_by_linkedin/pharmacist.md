# How to Write a Pharmacist Job Description

To attract a qualified pharmacist, start with a concise, professional job posting. The best job descriptions not only touch on your company’s overarching mission and expectations but also give candidates insight into the impact they could have in the short and long term.

Keep your posting direct, but infuse some personality. Provide thorough information on what you’re looking for in a pharmacist, and you’re likely to draw in more applications from candidates who meet your needs.
## What Does a Pharmacist Do?

A pharmacist is a trained medical professional whose primary role is to dispense medications to patients in accordance with the guidelines of a doctor, veterinarian, or other professional licensed to prescribe drugs. But pharmacists are responsible for more than just filling pill bottles. For each prescription, a pharmacist must investigate possible adverse effects and potential interactions with other substances. They must educate the patient on how to take the drug. The public relies upon pharmacists to properly manage controlled drugs, substances, or chemicals—a responsibility that should not be taken lightly. To succeed in the role, a pharmacist must be diligent, detail-oriented, and committed to supporting the health of their patients.
