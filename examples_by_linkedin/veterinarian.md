# How To Write a Veterinarian Job Description

Attracting and hiring an experienced veterinarian to your role begins with writing a concise, compelling job posting. Your posting should convey the commitment your practice has to helping animals in your community and offer candidates an idea of how they will contribute to your greater mission.

You should provide specific details on which qualifications you’re looking for in a candidate, but you’re likely to draw more candidates if you also touch on your practice’s culture. Veterinarians work long hours in high-stress situations, so many seek a supportive work environment. Let candidates know how your work setting will allow them to perform their job better.
## What Does a Veterinarian Do?

A veterinarian is a medical professional who treats disease, injury, and other medical issues in animals. Veterinarians or their practice may choose to specialize in a particular area of veterinary medicine. These areas include small animal practice (these are the vets you’ll see for your family’s cat or dog), large animal practice (including livestock and equine species), and aquatic medicine. But the possible areas of focus extends beyond this short list. A veterinarian’s specific responsibilities will vary depending on their area of focus, but overall they work to solve any medical issue that an animal may suffer from.
