## What Does an Orthopedic Surgeon Do?

An orthopedic surgeon is a medical doctor who specializes in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of disorders of the musculoskeletal system, including the bones, muscles, joints, ligaments, and tendons. Some orthopedic surgeons are generalists, while others specialize in specific areas of the body, such as the spine, foot and ankle, or hands. These medical professionals use both non-surgical and surgical methods to treat musculoskeletal trauma, degenerative diseases, infections, spine disorders, sports injuries, tumors, and congenital disorders. If the patient does not respond to non-invasive therapies, it may be necessary to recommend surgical treatment. The overall goal of an orthopedic surgeon is to return the patient to a more active, pain-free, and enjoyable life.
