## What Does a Product Manager Do?

Within many industries, product managers are responsible for guaranteeing the success of a specific product or product line. These extreme doers are product experts with a powerful capability to make strategic decisions based on market and competitor analyses. Prior to production, they create the roadmap to guide a product from conception through design and into wide release. Product managers bridge the gap among the different departments involved in successfully bringing your product(s) to market, including R&amp;D, engineering, manufacturing, marketing, sales, and customer support. Their ultimate goal is the creation and launch of products that meet consumers’ needs — growing market share and success.
