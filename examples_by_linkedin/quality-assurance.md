# How to Write a Quality Assurance Job Description

If you’re hiring for a quality assurance specialist, your job description needs to be impeccable. These experts have an eye for detail and will be looking for a company that values detail too. Excite job seekers with specific tasks they will be working on. Share what success looks like in the role—and how their work will make a long-term impact. Provide facts about the education, skills, and experience they should bring to the position. Avoid long lists of qualifications—and grab the candidate’s attention by infusing your description with vividness and specificity.

## What Does Quality Assurance Do?

Companies that deliver high-quality products and services depend on quality assurance (QA) to deliver on their promise. A quality assurance specialist ensures that the final product observes the company’s quality standards. In general, these detail-oriented professionals are responsible for the development and implementation of inspection activities, the detection and resolution of problems, and the delivery of satisfactory outcomes. Should any defects be found, it’s up to the QA specialist to apply corrective actions. For example, in IT, QA employees test software, systems, and workflows for errors and verification before and during deployment.
