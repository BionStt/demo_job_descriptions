# How to Write a Physical Therapist Job Description

To attract a well-qualified physical therapist, your job description needs to be equally captivating and informative. It should convey your organization in a way that communicates your expertise, values, and company culture.  Job seekers aren’t just looking for a role that fits their training, they’re looking for a team that will support their growth and makes them excited to come to work each day.

Furthermore, a job posting is the first introduction to your organization, and a chance to differentiate you from your competitors. So as you write your list of qualifications, responsibilities, and expectations, think about it from the perspective of the candidate. What detail(s) are they going to care most about? A LinkedIn study found that compensation was the most important part of the job description. Yet not a lot of companies are comfortable including this information, so this is one tactic you can use to set yourself apart from the competition. Plus once you’ve hooked them, they’ll be eager to hear about everything else the role offers.
## What Does A Physical Therapist Do?

If you have an illness or injury that prevents you from doing basic tasks, or limits you from taking part in sports or other hobbies, a physical therapist can help you get back to where you need to be. Physical therapists are certified health care professionals who help patients reduce pain and improve mobility following an illness or injury. A physical therapist can work in a small private practice or within a larger rehabilitation center at a hospital or outpatient health clinic. These individuals assume leadership roles in preventing loss of mobility, enabling rehabilitation, and educating individuals on how to live healthier lives. In some cases, a physical therapist can help conduct research to support new practices that can enhance wellness and fitness in patients.
