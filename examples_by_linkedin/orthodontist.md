## What Does an Orthodontist Do?

Orthodontists are registered dental specialists committed to creating the best smile possible for children and adults. While orthodontists are primarily known for straightening teeth, they can also assist with misaligned and painful bites, tooth movement caused by bad habits such as bruxism (also known as tooth-grinding), and even some forms of sleep apnea. Using their knowledge and expertise in facial irregularities, the jaw, and tooth position, an orthodontist can help you understand which of many available treatment options will be best for you or your child. Between fixed and removable plates, metal braces, ceramic braces, and clear aligners, there are treatments to suit nearly any need or lifestyle.
