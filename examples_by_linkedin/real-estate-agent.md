# How to Write a Real Estate Agent Job Description

It’s important to write a clear and relatable real estate agent job description that explains the job expectations as concisely as possible. You can include information that’ll highlight your company’s core values and mission, as well as day-to-day job expectations. Use brief, bullet-pointed lists for qualifications and responsibilities, and make sure they align with your needs.

## What Does a Real Estate Agent Do?

From a first consultation about buying a new place to live move to actually taking the leap, buyers (and sellers) of property typically have a real estate agent by their side. Responsibilities span the gamut, including: providing expertise about property types and specific neighborhoods  scheduling showings, performing comparative pricing analyses, introducing resources (mortgage originators / banks, title companies, real estate lawyers, architects, contractors), negotiating on price, and driving toward a final close.

For buyers, real estate agents may suggest a vision for any given property. For sellers, they may coordinate the staging of a property to show its best potential. In essence, agents do whatever they can to make the sale happen smoothly and quickly for their clients.

A real estate agent may work for themselves (and in most states, must obtain the proper license to do so), or work in an agency, along with other agents. Or, they might work for a specific developer, showcasing model homes or units to sell newly developed property.
