# How to Write a Respiratory Therapist Job Description

To attract the right respiratory therapist for your hospital, lab, or clinic, start by writing a job posting that is professional and thorough. When you post a job, you’re not just advertising a position—you’re putting your best foot forward in order to persuade the top talent in the job market to work with you. For your respiratory therapist job description, consider touching on what your staff of medical professionals can offer patients, any areas of focus for the new hire and how the therapist will contribute to the overall success of your hospital.
## What Does a Respiratory Therapist Do?

Respiratory therapists are trained medical professionals whose primary responsibility is to care for patients who have trouble breathing. Patients may suffer from chronic respiratory issues such as asthma, or they may have injured or diseased lungs. Respiratory therapists also help patients in medical emergencies, including after a drowning or heart attack, to breathe effectively. These professionals may work in a variety of settings, including within hospitals or rehabilitation centers. There are seven different areas of respiratory therapy; for each area, a therapist must earn an associated certification in order to practice.
