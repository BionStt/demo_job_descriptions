## What Does a Psychiatrist Do?

A psychiatrist is a medical doctor who specializes in mental health. Psychiatrists assess patients using both laboratory and psychological techniques, as well as by communicating with them to understand their unique genetics and family history. Following an assessment, psychiatrists make a diagnosis and develop a treatment plan that may include a variety of therapies. Common therapies include psychotherapy, medication, and psychosocial intervention. Sometimes, more extensive therapies (including electroconvulsive therapy) are necessary. Unlike psychologists, psychiatrists are medical doctors and can prescribe medication.
