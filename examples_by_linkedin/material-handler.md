# How to Write a Material Handler Job Description

## What Does a Material Handler Do?

Material handlers put products in the places they need to be. This may sound vague, but the role is essential. In warehouses and production facilities, material handlers find products on shelves, wrap or package them appropriately, and place them on delivery trucks; they may also take products off of trucks and put them on shelves. Thanks to material handlers, customer orders can be fulfilled and moved quickly. In some cases, these professionals may work with automated machines to make the handling process even faster.
