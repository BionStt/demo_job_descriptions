# How to Write a Data Scientist Job Description

Finding the best data scientist for your company depends on a well-written job description, and it all starts with a powerful summary of the position and its role within your company. While much of it is an outline of qualifications, duties, and objectives, a good portion should convey what it’s like to work for your company and how your candidate will make an impact. Keep it short, sweet, and jargon-free whenever possible, and you’ll ensure that quality candidates will click, read, and respond.

## What Does a Data Scientist Do?

A data scientist knows how to extract meaning from and interpret data. This unique skill set requires the aid of statistical methods and machinery, but largely relies on analytical brain power. Because raw data can rarely be utilized reliably, businesses in a variety of industries look to these technical experts to collect, clean, and validate their data. This meticulous process requires persistence and software engineering skills—expertise that’s integral to understanding data bias and to debug output from code. In simpler terms, data scientists find patterns and use the knowledge to build and improve.
