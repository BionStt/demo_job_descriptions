# How to Write a Supervisor Job Description

You’ll attract strong supervisor applicants if your job description is simple and straightforward. Let candidates know how important they’ll be to your company’s success, and what they can expect of the role and work environment. Include details on the qualifications you require and the day-to-day responsibilities, but avoid a long list. Keep it brief and engaging, and the right candidates will apply.

## What Does a Supervisor Do?

Any high-performing company team, department, or shift has a supervisor guiding them. These “coaches” are responsible for the daily tasks of the group, aligning projects with business goals, constructing detailed work schedules, managing employees, achieving milestones, and communicating with upper management along the way. Many also serve as the face of the company, interacting with customers or clients, and ensuring a satisfactory experience.

A thriving supervisor gets the best from both people and projects. They work in industries as diverse as information healthcare, construction, engineering, and landscaping. These individuals are detail-oriented, with a mind for business, which helps them keep projects or programs on schedule and within scope and budget, with flawless execution.
