# How to Write a CFO Job Description

Because this role is essential to a company’s success, you should set the bar high in the recruitment process. You’ll be able to attract and hire the best fit for the job if you create an effective CFO job description. Your posting should be detailed, yet brief and to the point. Much of the description should be in list form for easy readability. It should contain an introduction to your company and its culture, while clearly spelling out the expectations of the position.

A strong CFO job posting will convey how the individual will contribute from the date of hire and how their efforts will have an impact over time. Remember, job seekers are comparing many potential positions, and you want yours to stand out.
## What Does a CFO Do?

As a company grows, it often needs more than accountants and controllers to manage finances. This is when the services of a chief financial officer (CFO) are required. These financial experts do much more than simply make sure the numbers add up at the end of the month. Whether it’s a 20-employee firm or a corporation of thousands, companies rely on the CFO for critical financial strategies and performance management, based on backward-looking analyses and forward-looking projections. A CFO’s day-to-day tasks may vary, but he or she is focused on the future, using the past to inform and guide his employer’s overall financial performance.
