## What Does a Logistics Manager Do?

A logistics manager is in charge of overseeing the purchase and distribution of products in a supply chain. Whether working for a logistics company, retail chain, or engineering company, this professional shoulders most of the responsibility for ensuring that valuable goods arrive at their destination safely. They spend a good amount of time handling technical details related to transportation. These include documentation and compliance with customs regulations and legal requirements, and budget planning for storage and assets. Because they often supervise the work of other logistics staff, including planners, schedulers, and dispatchers, logistic managers must have excellent communication skills.
