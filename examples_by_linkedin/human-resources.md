# How to Write a Human Resources Job Description

Human Resource (HR) professionals understand people and processes, so be sure to create an effective job description that will speak to the right candidates. To attract strong HR professionals, let candidates know how their contributions will impact your company and what they can do to be successful. Be direct about the culture of your organization, so candidates can understand your values and mission.

Carefully read through the responsibilities and qualifications to ensure they appropriately reflect the job expectations. Avoid using technical jargon if possible, and focus instead on being concise and straightforward.
