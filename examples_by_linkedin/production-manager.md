# How to Write A Production Manager Job Description

To find the best production managers, start with a well-written, engaging job description. Optimize your posting with information about your company, a comprehensive list of qualifications, and the key responsibilities involved.

Keep the posting detailed, but concise to help candidates get the information they need quickly. According to LinkedIn’s behavioral data, job posts with 150 words or less got candidates to apply 17.8% more frequently than job posts with 450 to 600 words. Plus since more than 50% of job views on LinkedIn are on mobile devices, shorter descriptions are better suited for modern candidates.
