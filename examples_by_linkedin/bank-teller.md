## What Does a Bank Teller Do?

Bank tellers handle one of the most important assets in our culture—money. As with any consumer operation, banks rely on these individuals to deliver exceptional service, as they perform financial transactions for their customers. Day-to-day, they handle withdrawals, deposits, transfers, and other financial activities, all while delivering a positive customer experience. Because they have responsibility for the cash that flows in and out of their drawers, they’re often tasked with verifying identities, as well as promoting new products that may benefit the customer.
