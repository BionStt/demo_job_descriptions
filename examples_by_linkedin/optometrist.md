# Optometrist Job Description

The most successful optometrists are well-educated, experienced, and personable. If that sounds like the kind of person you’d like to hire for your practice, you need to create a job posting that clearly conveys this. The ideal optometrist job description reveals how the candidate’s expertise will impact patients, as well as the organization as a whole. How will this person’s contributions affect professional and organizational growth and success? What will be expected of them on a day-to-day basis? If you are clear about the values and culture of your organization, you’re more likely to attract candidates who will be a great fit for the role.

Carefully review your list of optometrist responsibilities and requirements to ensure they accurately reflect the expectations of the job. Avoid using technical and industry jargon as much as possible. Instead, use concise and direct language.
## What Does an Optometrist Do?

Optometrists are primary healthcare specialists trained to examine the eyes to detect defects in vision, signs of injury, ocular diseases or abnormalities, and problems with general health, such as high blood pressure or diabetes. New technologies have helped the profession to expand both the scope and the efficiency of practice. Optometrists and their patients now benefit from the many advances in eye care and medical technology. Additionally, new procedures like laser surgery can correct vision and diseases, such as glaucoma, providing better options for patients who need them. While they are not surgeons, optometrists are often the healthcare providers who consult with patients about these new technologies and treatments.
