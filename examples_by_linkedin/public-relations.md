## What Does Public Relations Do?

At its core, public relations (PR) is the process of communicating to the public, through the press (traditional, broadcast, online), social media, speaking engagements, and other earned avenues. Distinct from owned publications (e.g. a company’s own website) or paid placements (e.g. print ads or commercials), the most classic PR features and mentions are gained through merit—without compensation or kickbacks to the featuring journalist, publication, or show. Many organizations use the power of PR to grow, guide, and manage the perception of their brands and entities (or the products or services they sell). With a well-placed feature article or prominent talk show appearance, PR professionals often contribute heft and prestige, which can in turn boost marketing and advertising efforts to create synergy and momentum in the market.  

An effective public relations professional will analyze your company’s newsworthiness, find interesting and timely themes, and turn them into compelling stories. If the company’s image is threatened by a crisis or other negative circumstance, PR professionals can also formulate a helpful strategy—and mitigate the damage.
