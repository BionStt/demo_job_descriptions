# How to Write a General Surgeon Job Description

A great general surgeon job description starts with an engaging summary of the position and its role within your organization. Your description should share an overview of your culture and the types of patients you see, as well as your expectations for the person who fills the position. Outline the responsibilities and activities the general surgeon will take on, making sure to list your highest-priority qualifications. Keep all information brief but sufficiently detailed to give candidates a good idea of what the position looks like, and whether they might be a fit.
## What Does a General Surgeon Do?

Medical professionals do all they can to use noninvasive treatments for a variety of conditions, but sometimes surgery is necessary. When it is, a general surgeon is there to perform the procedure and ensure that it goes as smoothly as possible. Don’t be fooled by the term &quot;general,” though. These surgeons perform highly specialized procedures related to abdominal issues, including appendicitis, hernias, gallbladder malfunction, and stomach and intestinal dysfunction.
