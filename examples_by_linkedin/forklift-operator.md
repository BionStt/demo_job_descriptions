## What Does a Forklift Operator Do?

Employed across many different industries, forklift operators move heavy materials from one place to another using special industrial tractors, lifts, and trucks. These certified professionals are critical to the success of any business, not only driving this heavy-duty machinery, but often unloading or loading components, running tests, and adjusting controls. Many of their duties are performed in a warehouse, dockyard, factory, or construction site, but they can work wherever products or equipment are stored on pallets or stacked on industrial shelving. When anything needs to be moved, a forklift operator can do the job.
