## What Does an IT Manager Do?

In our world of smartphones, mobile apps, and tablets, businesses must be more connected than ever to stay ahead. The role of an IT manager within an organization is to ultimately identify and bring forth technology infrastructure and solutions to propel the company forward. There are plenty of daily tasks to keep IT managers busy, but the most effective managers keep an eye on important business indicators. These technical experts serve as the liaison between the business side of the organization and the technical side, identifying needs, communicating findings, and making recommendations. IT managers are expected to advise businesses on technology and how it can help them perform better, then oversee new systems design, development, and implementation.
