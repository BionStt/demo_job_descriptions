# How to Write a Business Development Job Description

You’ll want to start by setting the bar high in the recruitment process. Share some information about your thriving company, and demonstrate how the right candidate will have an impact. Then, outline the qualifications, duties, and objectives clearly and briefly, and give it a few read-throughs before posting. If you feel like you’ve illustrated what it’s like to work in business development at your company, candidates will notice.

## What Does Business Development Do?

Many organizations have a dedicated function that pursues opportunities for long-term growth and revenue from customers, markets, and relationships. This is known as business development, and the most successful companies have a well-oiled department working on it at all times. Business development professionals understand the fundamental drivers of the business, customers, partners, and competitors. Their insight is critical to making smart decisions in the pursuit of long-term business value. Whether working with an idea, product, service, or relationship, most business development roles are selling something at some point. The interplay among strategy, relationship management, and sales ultimately fuels the company's growth path.
