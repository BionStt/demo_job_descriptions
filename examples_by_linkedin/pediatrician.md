# How to Write a Pediatrician Job Description

Consider the typical pediatrician: driven, focused, and passionate about the patients they serve. Your job posting needs to reflect these qualities. Try to incorporate role objectives in a clear and concise manner, but also illustrate your unique practice and the community you serve. Start by introducing your practice, then provide details about your expectations for the role. Finally, give the candidate an idea of their day-to-day responsibilities. Will they be the only pediatrician on staff, or one of many? Are candidates expected to be on call for patients or caregivers, or will their hours be clear-cut? A strong pediatrician job description will provide enough detail to attract high caliber candidates.

## What Does a Pediatrician Do?

Pediatricians are doctors who care for infants, children, and adolescents. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends people remain under pediatric care until age 21—so in essence, a pediatrician cares for their patients until they’re well into adulthood. From birth until age two, children will visit their pediatrician multiple times a year; after that, they will continue to see their pediatrician at least once a year for a general exam. During these visits, the pediatrician will measure the child’s growth and development, give vaccines according to schedule, consult on pubescent changes, make any necessary referrals to specialists, and treat any of a multitude of common childhood illnesses.
