# How to Write a Nurse Job Description

Finding an exceptional nurse for your organization starts with a solid job description. You’ll attract strong candidates if your nurse job posting is clear and compelling. Share some information about your company culture, the position, and the impact they’ll have on patients. Applicants will want to know whether they meet your specific qualifications, so focus on making these as realistic as possible. Focus on keeping your nurse job description brief, while still sharing relevant details. Proofread and check your posting for accuracy once it feels complete.

## What Does a Nurse Do?

Wherever there is a patient in need of medical care, you can be sure there is a nurse working tirelessly to care for them. These healthcare professionals go through rigorous training to be able to successfully assess, monitor, and treat patients under the direction of a physician. Registered nurses work with a variety of patients across a wide spectrum of environments. They care for ill and injured people, and also provide healthy individuals with preventative care. Many nurses specialize in one area of healthcare and work only with particular types of patients, such as newborns or cancer patients, while others practice general care.
