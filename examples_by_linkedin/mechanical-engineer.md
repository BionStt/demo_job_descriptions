# How to Write a Mechanical Engineer Job Description

Engage the strongest candidates with an outstanding job posting. When writing your list of responsibilities and requirements for the mechanical engineer position, take the time to check that they reflect the expectations of your ideal candidate. Your lists should be short — 4 to 6 bullets — and concise, avoiding complex language.

In your job description, introduce candidates to your organization’s culture and values. Provide a brief overview of the skills and qualities your ideal candidate(s) should have while letting them know how their work will impact the success of your organization.
## What Does a Mechanical Engineer Do?

Mechanical engineering is one of the largest engineering fields. Mechanical engineers work in many different industries — in both the public and private sectors. Using their extensive analytic and design skills, they research, develop, and build everything from tools and engines to machines and sensors.

Mechanical engineers integrate extensive computer knowledge into their work, uncovering how mechanical and thermal machines can aid in solving problems. They’re key contributors in investigating equipment failures and overseeing the creation of products (like medical devices and steam turbines) that offer innovative mechanical solutions.
