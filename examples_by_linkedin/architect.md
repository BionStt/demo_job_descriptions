## What Does an Architect Do?

If you have a major building project to tackle, whether it’s designing a new building, tackling a large-scale renovation, or completing a smaller-scale restoration, you may be wondering where to begin. You would start by calling an architect. Working for private architectural firms, government, construction companies, retailers, or manufacturers, architects oversee building and renovation projects from beginning to end. These individuals can play a role in all aspects of the project, from site selection and feasibility studies to construction observation and project closeout procedures. At a minimum, the architect is usually responsible for design, documentation, and permitting.
