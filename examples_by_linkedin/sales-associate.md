# How to Write a Sales Associate Job Description

Attracting and hiring the ideal sales associate starts with a well written job description. A strong posting is an opportunity to introduce your company and clearly communicate the expectations for the role. Let candidates know how they’ll contribute from day one—and how their work will positively impact company success and growth.  

Your lists of duties and qualifications should be concise and focused, using no more than six bullet points for each section. Carefully review each bullet to ensure they align with expectations of the position, getting rid of the ones that aren’t critical to know.
## What Does a Sales Associate Do?

As an essential part of every company’s public persona, sales associates are responsible for providing customers with an excellent buying experience. They greet customers with a smile, learn their needs and desires, recommend appropriate purchases, answer questions, and even handle customer complaints and other issues. Whether they staff a retail storefront or a wholesale distribution center, the best sales associates are sharp communicators with an intuition for pleasing the customer.
