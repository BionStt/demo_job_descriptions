## What Does a Software Engineer Do?

In an increasingly digital world, software engineers are a key player for business success. Software engineers work in retail, healthcare, research and development, technology, and dozens of other industries. They might ensure an organization’s operating systems and networks are performing at maximum capacity—and when they aren’t, they use their skill sets to find out why and fix it.
