## What Does a Teacher Do?

A teacher has the important responsibility of imparting knowledge, skills, and lessons on kids and adults. The best teachers are passionate about the subjects they teach—and they’re passionate about transferring what they know to help develop a student’s capabilities. A day in the life of a teacher can vary greatly depending on their subject and grade level. From preschool to kindergarten to high school and special education, one theme runs consistently throughout every great teacher's career: their work day extends far beyond the school day and year. Writing lesson plans, researching current events and information, grading papers, and more, take up much of a teacher’s time outside of the classroom. Education in the U.S. is considered a state and local issue, which means requirements vary for prospective teachers.
