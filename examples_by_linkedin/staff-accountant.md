# How to Write a Staff Accountant Job Description

Because of these important responsibilities, it’s necessary for your company to find and hire the right staff accountants. The first step is to visualize your ideal employee and write a job description that aligns with that person.

The job description is your company’s introduction and invitation, giving candidates a glimpse into your mission and job expectations. To make the best impression, keep it simple and concise while providing as much detail as possible. Once you compile your list, double-check that all the information is accurate and you’ve included all the key qualifications and duties.
## What Does a Staff Accountant Do?

Today, many organizations and accounting firms are looking for talented people with general accounting skills to join their finance departments. These staff accountants work under the supervision of a director or certified public accountant (CPA), performing general bookkeeping, maintaining financial reports, records, and general ledgers; and preparing and analyzing budgets. While accountants fall into a number of categories, including auditors, tax accountants, and investment accountants, staff accountants are typically less experienced. But they’re highly educated on the preservation, allocation, and growth of financial resources.
