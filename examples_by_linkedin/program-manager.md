# How to Write a Program Manager Job Description

To help your organization achieve its biggest goals, you need a strong program manager on your team. Attracting and hiring the ideal program manager starts with a powerful job description. The basics are simple. Your program manager job description should be direct and concise. Using simple language, tell candidates how their work will influence the success of your company. Introduce your organizational values and culture to entice program managers who share your ideals and vision.

Make sure each item on your lists of duties, responsibilities, and qualifications accurately reflects the expectations of the program manager position. Review them carefully, removing any that aren’t applicable or crucial. Keep your lists short, with no more than six bullet points in each.
## What Does a Program Manager Do?

In many organizations, it might take the completion of multiple individual projects to achieve one bigger, overarching goal. When these different projects are all dependent on one another, it can be a challenge to keep them organized. This is where program managers shine. Program managers are responsible for overseeing the achievement of larger organizational goals. They coordinate efforts between different projects without managing any one of them. Instead, they lead the overall program with strong attention to strategy, implementation, and delegation. Program managers are highly skilled professionals who help organizations stay on schedule, on spec, and ultimately on an upward trajectory of success and growth.
