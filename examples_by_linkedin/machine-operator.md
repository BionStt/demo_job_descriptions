# How to Write a Machine Operator Job Description

Finding an experienced, reliable machine operator starts with writing a job description that is both informative, inviting, and appealing to a diverse applicant pool. In order to do that, it’s important to use gender neutral language.
A study highlighted in the American Psychological Association’s Journal of Personality and Social Psychology found that found that job descriptions with masculine words made women less interested in applying, even though it didn’t make them feel less qualified. You can encourage more women to apply by avoiding terms like “strong,” “assertive,” and “ninja.” See the <a href="https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/blog/job-descriptions/2016/17-words-that-are-turning-women-away-from-your-jobs">17 words that are turning women away from your jobs</a> (and what to use instead).

## What Does a Machine Operator Do?

A machine operator is responsible for working with heavy machinery so that companies are able to manufacture and distribute goods effectively. These professionals set up machinery to start a production cycle, operate and oversee equipment, test machines to make sure they’re running smoothly, feed raw materials into semi-automated machines, and adhere to health and safety regulations at all times. Machine operators must be meticulous, skilled individuals who can contribute directly to the success of a company’s product. Excelling in this role takes years of on-the-job training: it’s vital to understand the nuances—and hazards—of each particular machine.
