# How to Write a Marketing Director Job Description

Marketing directors understand how to sell, so you’ll want your job description to be compelling to find a great candidate. A successful marketing director job posting is brief and to the point. It should concisely introduce your company values while explaining the expectations of the job.

When crafting your list of qualifications, objectives, and duties, try to stick to four to six bullets per section. Be sure to read through the description carefully, keeping an eye out for inconsistencies and grammatical errors.
## What Does a Marketing Director Do?

The success of a company’s products or services often relies on marketing. At the helm of the marketing department is the marketing director, tasked with overseeing the development and implementation of marketing strategies, and with guiding the team that executes them. Marketing directors understand their offering and their target audience, and see to it that projects are completed on time and on budget. They either work for a marketing firm that handles various clients — or in-house at a company or organization.
