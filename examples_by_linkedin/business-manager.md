# How to Write a Business Manager Job Description

Your business manager job description should use clear, direct language to tell candidates how their work will influence the success of your organization from day one. It should also introduce candidates to your culture and values, allowing them to determine if they share your ideals.

Your lists of duties, responsibilities, and qualifications should be no more than six bullet points each. Take the time to carefully review each bullet, making sure each one accurately reflects the expectations of the position.
## What Does a Business Manager Do?

For any organization to optimize its success, it should run like a well-oiled machine. Day in and day out, it needs to provide employees with the resources they need to complete their work at a high level. When an organization has a strong business manager, then there is someone there to oil the gears.

Business managers might oversee a specific department within a large company. In smaller companies, they might oversee all departments. In either case, they’re the captains that manage daily activities, supervise work, and push toward financial and operational objectives. With strong leadership skills, business managers are key to the day-to-day — and ultimately, long-term — success of organizations large and small.
